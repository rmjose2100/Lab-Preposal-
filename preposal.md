# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

# Our idea is to make a visual novel-style game based on a math quiz. The idea of our project as of now is to have four basic components where we develop the art style, a math generator a text system that takes in inputs from the user, and  a health point system. We aim to use a Ren'Py as Tony has some experience in it thus it should ensure a smooth sailing (as much as possible) project setup. From there, we're gonna try and make a basic art style and combine that with a simple input-output function. The goal here is to use as much as the lab work concepts we done to try and make something cool 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Tony Zhang , Subhan Ahmad , Me(Reuben Jose)

## Do you have any questions of your own?

# The question I have personally is if there is a way we can use Matlab in some way to make a score board but i feel like our game might either be too simple for one or that it is not needed.
